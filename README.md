- See [`Project Architecture`](#project-architecture) for a summarization of microservices & Spring Cloud components.

- See `Bussiness Logic` for how microservices interact with each other.


## How to deploy

- **Before you run it**: Make sure you have installed docker and docker-compose. Allocate enough RAM for your docker containers (8GB may be enough), as 12 containers will be running once started.

- In your terminal: 
  
  - `git clone the project`
  
  - `cd local-deployment`

  - `docker compose up`

  - Wait for 1 or 2 minutes for all the service to be up and functioning.
